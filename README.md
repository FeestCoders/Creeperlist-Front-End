## Back-End 

here isn't much information here, and I (Ashlyn) don't do much in this area, so this should probably be written by someone else. 

## API

What will the [api](https://github.com/FeestCoders/creeperlist-api), on the other hand, do? It handles voting, adding servers, keeping track of server ids, determining whether or not a server is sponsored, and, of course, registering and logging in. Part of the api is already in here.

Please keep in mind that some of the features come from the API and will be relocated once the repository is open source.
