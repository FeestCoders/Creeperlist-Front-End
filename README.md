## .env File

All you really have to know about the .env file is that NEXT_PUBLIC_api="epic-api-url.com" will be the api.

## API

What will the [api](https://github.com/FeestCoders/creeperlist-api), on the other hand, do? It handles voting, adding servers, keeping track of server ids, determining whether or not a server is sponsored, and, of course, registering and logging in.
