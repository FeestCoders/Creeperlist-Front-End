## API

What will the [api](https://github.com/FeestCoders/creeperlist-api), on the other hand, do? It handles voting, adding servers, keeping track of server ids, determining whether or not a server is sponsored, and, of course, registering and logging in. Part of the api is already in here.

Please note that this is far from done and that most features don't even work.
